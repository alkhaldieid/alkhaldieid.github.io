Here’s a detailed guide of the steps I took. Step 1: Install Hugo To install Hugo, I followed the instructions from the official Hugo website: Hugo Installation Guide. # Install Hugo on Linux using Snap sudo snap install hugo Step 2: Initialize the Hugo Project After installation, I initialized the Hugo project: hugo new site my_website Step 3: Add the LoveIt Theme To add the LoveIt theme, I used Git submodules: git submodule add https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt.git themes/LoveIt Step 4: Configure Hugo I customized the `config.toml` file by updating the site title, base URL, and other settings: baseURL = \"https://alkhaldieid.github.io/\" languageCode = \"en-us\" title = \"Eid Alkhaldi - AI \u0026 Tech Insights\" theme = \"LoveIt\" defaultTheme = \"dark\" Step 5: Build and Deploy Once the configuration was done, I used Hugo to generate the static files: hugo Finally, I committed the changes to the `public/` folder and pushed the site to GitHub Pages. My website is now live at: https://alkhaldieid.github.io/.

Initially, I used MS Word, but aligning images manually was frustrating and took over an hour every day. It wasn’t efficient and prevented me from focusing on more strategic tasks. Being a fan of automating repetitive work, I turned to LaTeX and Python. Using LaTeX helped streamline the formatting, but I realized the reports followed a repetitive structure. With some encouragement from my colleague Ali Alzahrani, I decided to automate the entire process. I spent a few hours coding and iteratively refining a tool. The result? What used to take an hour now takes less than 5 seconds. The tool automatically pulls images, generates LaTeX code, and compiles a perfectly formatted PDF report, ready to submit. This journey taught me the power of coding to solve real-world problems and optimize workflows. If you’re facing similar challenges, feel free to check out the tool I built. It’s available for free on my GitHub: https://lnkd.in/dQCqZbC8. I hope it helps others save time and focus on what truly matters. 🚀 من الإحباط إلى الأتمتة: رحلة في كفاءة إعداد التقارير بصفتي نائب مدير الموقع، كنت مسؤولًا عن إعداد تقارير يومية للجهات الحكومية توثق العمل المنجز، وكانت هذه التقارير تعتمد بشكل كبير على الصور. في البداية، اعتمدت على MS Word، لكن تنسيق الصور يدويًا كان مرهقًا ويستغرق أكثر من ساعة يوميًا. قررت الاستفادة من خبرتي في LaTeX وPython لأتمتة العملية بالكامل. باستخدام LaTeX، تمكنت من تبسيط التنسيق، لكن العملية كانت مكررة يوميًا. بدعم من زميلي علي الزهراني، برمجت أداة تقوم بكل شيء تلقائيًا. النتيجة؟ التقارير التي كانت تستغرق ساعة تُنجز الآن في أقل من 5 ثوانٍ. الأداة ترتب الصور، تولد كود LaTeX، وتنتج تقريرًا PDF جاهزًا للإرسال. إذا كنت تواجه تحديات مماثلة، اكتشف الأداة مجانًا على GitHub: https://lnkd.in/dQCqZbC8.
